I searched far and wide for advice on how to launch a successful customer experience program. You see, I was taking on the brave new world of CX and didn’t want to repeat all the mistakes others had already made. I wanted to learn from the hard won ‘best practices’. I wanted to reduce risk and start from a position of knowledge and wisdom.  What I have learned so far is that in the end it comes down to the basics. The building blocks of a CX program are intention, insights and innovation.

**Intention:** 
It all starts here, doesn’t it? A successful CX program starts with the right intention - from all parts of the organization. It needs to rain down from the top and it needs to grow like dandelions at the ground level. The CEO needs to believe that our customers deserve the best experience we can possibly provide and that their loyalty is earned.The employees need to feel the joy and validation of serving the customers in the right way and should feel empowered to do so. And every layer of management in between needs to regard boosting the customer’s experience as the ultimate barometer of accomplishment.

Research conducted by *Chief Executive Magazine* and *Walker Research* has shown that, among other key insights, that customer-focused CEOs view customer experience as a clear differentiator and a sound method for creating a competitive advantage. 

**Insights**
Let’s say you have all the right intentions and executive sponsorship. In order to make a change, the root cause of the problem needs to be discovered. In other words, you need to understand what matters to your customers. It is imperative to listen for feedback in all the right places that matter - surveys, tickets, emails and even meetings and briefings.  And don’t forget the key role that product experience plays in Customer Experience. So, watching usage and looking for the patterns and insights there is important too. Determining a centralized accessible location to host that data becomes the next problem to solve. After that, comes the interesting test of parsing that data to identify the insights.  And mind you, identifying insights is only part of the process. It is not useful until we democratize and share those insights and use them to prioritize the right initiatives.  


**Innovation**
The final piece of the puzzle is the willingness to innovate. We often get stuck in the wheel of solving the fastest and easiest problems. How many times have you cringed at the term ‘low hanging fruit’ or ‘quick wins’? How many times have you needed to choose the ‘band aid’ over the actual cure due to pressures of proving ROI? We all have been there. And it is certainly a tough balance to continue to prove the value of the CX program, while keeping an eye on innovating experiences for our customers. However, there are trends in our industry that show that CX leaders who are investing in the future of experiences are beginning to see results.

So in the end, if you have the right intentions and willing to put in the effort to garner insights and focus on innovative experience, you're well on your way to improving your customer experience!
