I recently embarked on a learning tour to understand how the best and the brightest are approaching customer experience. I spoke with the CX leaders at 16 companies including Microsoft, LinkedIn, Google, Salesforce, SurveyMonkey, Box,  VMWare, Sony, Facebook, Gainsight, Cisco, and ServiceNow. 

It turns out that most CX journeys have very similar characteristics. I have been thinking about it as a blueprint. There are generally 4 phases to this journey.

**Phase One** is the beginning of the journey. Sometimes this is ignited by CEO or leadership desire to get closer to customers (40% of my interviewees indicated this), while in other cases this is triggered by negative customer feedback (40%) or losing customers (20%).

**Phase  Two** is focused on collecting information and where the foundations of CX are laid. Gathering information about customers and collecting that in a central location was the first step for every single one of the 16 companies I interviewed. Some instituted a data warehouse or a CX data platform, others launched surveys and yet others started customer journey mapping. 

**Phase Three** is where the action happens! Analyzing the data helps to identify gaps and spawn initiatives to improve customer experience. Some examples of initiatives this group has undertaken:
- Website redesign 
- Changing pricing structure
- Introduce in-product telemetry 
- Changing organizational structure 
- Targeted marketing campaigns
- Product and process changes 

**Phase Four** is all about measurement and iteration. A common strategy is to pick key performance indicators and align business goals and initiatives around it . 50% of those I interviewed use some form of sentiment metric (NPS, CSAT etc) as a KPI for their company. Another 25% put stock in financial indicators such as Churn or ARR. It was interesting to note that only very few companies have figured out the elusive link between satisfaction and financial performance. The remaining 25%, CX by measuring the improvements made with each large initiative.

As you might expect, this isn’t a linear journey by any means. Phases 2, 3 and 4 are carried out simultaneously often, and iteratively always. 

What does your company’s CX journey look like? What phase are you currently in?
