There are a lot of things on a CX leader’s mind as they start their journey. They might be thinking of the best way to listen to their customers, the ideal customer data platform to acquire, or even the first team members to hire. However, there is a silent enemy in wait for them, and if they aren’t careful, this invisible nemesis can trip up the very best of them. This invisible nemesis is ubiquitous in the world of business and all leaders recognize this as a threat. It is none other than silos. 

### What are silos?
The first definition of ’silo’ in the Merriam-Webster dictionary is _a trench, pit, or especially a tall cylinder (as of wood or concrete) usually sealed to exclude air and used for making and storing silage_. Although that is the original meaning of the word; the relevant definition for us is this alternate one: *an isolated grouping, department, etc., that functions apart from others especially in a way seen as hindering communication and cooperation*.

Most of us have worked in environments where one department doesn’t speak to another, except via some elaborate, cumbersome process. We have seen environments where sharing ideas, assets or code is seen as detrimental to one’s progress. We have participated in conversations where we have realized that another employee in a different division is working on the exact same thing as we are. Those are symptoms of the existence of silos in the work environment. Intuitively, we feel that silos are harmful to business and to employees, and yet they exist everywhere. Let’s explore why silos form in the first place.

### Why do silos form?
Silos do not form accidentally. More often than not, they are borne of confusion around objectives and goals within the executive leadership team.  In his book, Silos, Politics and Turf Wars, Patrick Lencioni writes,  “In most situations, silos rise up not because of what executives are doing purposefully but rather because of what they are failing to do: provide themselves and their employees with a compelling context for working together.”

If different executive leaders are compensated on divergent goals, then it follows that they are likely encouraging their teams to work on divergent initiatives. For example, if Sales is compensated on selling the product, but the Product team is not incentivized to make the products sellable, the teams won’t have the same goals in mind. 

Another reason for silos to form is lack of knowledge, understanding or empathy about what happens in other functions. These silos can form due to the faulty or incomplete communications channels between the functions. Lack of empathy for other employees, or a non-inclusive culture can also cause these silos to form and thrive.

### Which silos impede CX progress?
Although silos show up in many places in a business environment, not all silos impede CX progress equally.  In some cases silos are particularly insidious for the customer’s experience and CX leaders need to actively work towards dismantling them in order to be successful. 

**Organizational silos** Imagine you were assembling a puzzle and the pieces were scattered in separate rooms. That makes assembling the puzzle harder. Similarly, if Product, Marketing, Sales, Professional Services and Customer Service have different information about the customer’s experience, it will be more difficult to get the full picture. If these functions are siloed and information doesn’t easily flow through them, it will also be difficult to implement any change.

**Data silos** Now, imagine that the puzzle pieces were not only in separate rooms, but also made of separate materials. Maybe some were made of wood, others made of cardboard and yet others were made of glass. Assembling the puzzle just got harder. Silos of data is a common problem in most organizations. There are usually a multitude of data sources and an equal number of methods to analyze and visualize that data. The fractured nature of the data makes it hard to gather insights.

**Customer silos** Most puzzles come with a picture of the completed piece that can be used as a guide while assembling the puzzle. Finally, imagine that this guiding picture has been ripped up, and scattered in your neighbors houses. This will make the assembly a near-impossible task.  The silos in our customers’ environment also puts up barriers against improving customer experience. This is particularly true in B2B CX, when it is hard to gather consistent or comprehensive feedback from customers as different functions may not use the product similarly or have a homogenous experience.

### Why are silos harmful?
As written by Patrick Lencioni in his book*Silos, Politics and Turf Wars;*“Silos – and the turf wars they enable – devastate organizations. They waste resources, kill productivity, and jeopardize the achievement of goals. But beyond all that, they exact a considerable human toll too.” This invisible nemesis impedes progress and create barriers for ideas, information and innovation to flow freely within an organization. Silos are especially harmful for CX leaders, as theirs is one of the most cross functional jobs out there.  Tying the threads of knowledge that reside in each silo into a cohesive narrative of the customers’ experience is indeed a unique challenge for CX leaders.

### How to overcome silos?
**Awareness** The first step in demolishing silos is awareness. If the executive team doesn’t know that this invisible enemy exists, then they cannot take the appropriate actions.  From a CX perspective, it is important to take stock of the different functions that are interacting with the customers - are they using the same tone? is the messaging similar? More importantly, is the context and status of each interaction being passed on to the next, so that the customer experience in streamlined?

**Common goals and objectives** The next step is for the executive team to align on common goals. The goals and objectives then generate the associated initiatives and ensure that the whole company is rowing in the same direction. This creates cohesion that will positively impact the customer’s experience as well.

**Coordinated measurements.** The final steps to successfully dismantle silos lies in measuring outcomes in a coordinated way. If one function is measuring Net Promoter Score, another is measuring Customer Satisfaction Score and yet another is measuring the Customer Effort score, we don’t really know what is going on with with the customer, do we?


### Conclusion
So, while silos are insidious and harmful, they do not have to spell doom for an organization. With careful thought, planning and action companies can overcome silos and focus their efforts on delighting their customers.
